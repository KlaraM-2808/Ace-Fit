Babolat Pure Aero 2023,289.00,"With its ""best of class"" combination of speed, spin and power, the Pure Aero is one of the most popular and versatile racquets ever made.

It also possesses the kind of spin-friendly precision and raw power that is dangerous in the hands of aggressive players. For 2022, in addition to a more arm-friendly flex point, Babolat adds comfort with NF² Technology , which uses flax inserts in the handle and upper hoop to soften ball impact.

Boasting an appeal that cuts across ability levels, this modern player's racquet offers an unmistakably easy learning curve to virtually anyone looking to play aggressive tennis. Although it reserves its greatest charm for the baseliner who likes dictating action with heavy pace, it’s also dangerous in the front court, where the quick handling and powerful response practically beg you to finish volleys with a bang. Serving is another strength of the Pure Drive, where surgically placed slices and kickers are as easy to hit as flat bombs down the T. For 2025, Babolat, enhances comfort with an updated version of NF2 Tech, a dampening technology that uses flax fibers in the throat to smooth out harsh vibrations. This model also inherits FSI Power from the previous generation, consisting of a bundle of technologies that enable the racquet to transfer more energy to the ball (think easy power). Other features include Babolat’s HTR System, a layup construction that stiffens the hoop in a way that not only enhances power but also creates more stability and less frame wobble on off-center impact (think rebound control).

Featuring the same specs and playability as the standard cosmetic version, this racquet is a speedy spin monster with great ball feedback. Offering easier power than the VCORE 95, the VCORE 98 gives you the benefit of a larger margin of error without sacrificing the precision that experienced players crave. It's also extremely fast, making it great for cranking winners on the run or reacting quickly at net. For 2023 Yonex overhauls the ISOMETRIC head shape by creating an even roomier, more luxurious hitting zone in the upper hoop. The payoff is a more forgiving and stable hitting experience, with an expanded spin window and juicier levels of power. Yonex has also recontoured the VCORE shaft and made slight tweaks to the beam throughout the frame. Other new features include SIF Grommets , which deploys a silicone oil infusion to reduce the friction between the string and grommet. The upshot is greater string movement for increased snapback and more vicious ball rotation. Yonex has also lowered the RA, giving this stick an even more buttery feel at impact.

Yonex VCORE 98,305.00,"With its redesigned beam and softer feel, the 2023 VCORE 98 continues its reign as one of the game's most well-built player's racquets. Like previous versions, this is a speedy spin monster with great ball feedback. Offering easier power than the VCORE 95, the VCORE 98 gives you the benefit of a larger margin of error without sacrificing the precision that experienced players crave. It's also extremely fast, making it great for cranking winners on the run or reacting quickly at net. For 2023 Yonex overhauls the ISOMETRIC head shape by creating an even roomier, more luxurious hitting zone in the upper hoop. The payoff is a more forgiving and stable hitting experience, with an expanded spin window and juicier levels of power. Yonex has also recontoured the VCORE shaft and made slight tweaks to the beam throughout the frame. Other new features include SIF Grommets , which deploys a silicone oil infusion to reduce the friction between the string and grommet. The upshot is greater string movement for increased snapback and more vicious ball rotation. Yonex has also lowered the RA, giving this stick an even more buttery feel at impact. Like the previous generation, this racquet benefits from 2G-NAMD FlexForce Graphite in the upper shaft and lower hoop, enabling the racquet to flex optimally through impact. Ultimately, this redesigned VCORE 98 checks all the right boxes.
